About this folder
-----------------
This folder contains a directory that conatins the evaluation data, which consists of 6 hashtag files.


Evaluation Data
---------------

The evaluation data consits of a single directory with several files. Each file corresponds to a single hashtag, and is named appropriately. For example, for the hashtag #BadJobIn5Words, the file is called Bad_Job_In_5_Words.tsv. We add the underscore between hashtag tokens for easier parsing of the hahstags.

Since this is the evaluation data, labels are not provided. Predictions should be formatted according to the appropriate Subtask. Please visit the CodaLab websites for each subtask (Subtask A: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/15682#learn_the_details-evaluation and Subtask B: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/15689#learn_the_details-evaluation) for details on the output format for the Subtasks. Please feel free to post in the Google Group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hashtag-wars-semeval) for needed clarification.
