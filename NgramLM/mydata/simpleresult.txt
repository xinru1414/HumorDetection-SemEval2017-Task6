Musharraf's Last Act? -4.938246096445768
Desperate to hold onto power, Pervez Musharraf has discarded Pakistan's constitutional framework and declared a state of emergency. -4.665019902974532
His goal? -4.597064134165837
To stifle the independent judiciary and free media. -4.3430491220040786
Artfully, though shamelessly, he has tried to sell this action as an effort to bring about stability and help fight the war on terror more effectively. -3.731352507736768
Nothing could be further from the truth. -4.208924414359163
If Pakistan's history is any indicator, his decision to impose martial law may prove to be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back. -4.1107976248648725
General Musharraf appeared on the national scene on October 12, 1999, when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious "nation-building" project. -4.43457957686015
Many Pakistanis, disillusioned with Pakistan's political class, remained mute, thinking that he might deliver. -5.039381137480398
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America brought Musharraf into the international limelight as he agreed to ditch the Taliban and support the United States-led war on terror. -4.007397293193985
Musharraf clamped down on some religious militants operating inside Pakistan and also on those fighting Indian forces in Kashmir. -4.4039625433564815
As a result, Pakistan was rewarded with American financial assistance and arms. -4.510910476847573
In furtherance of his re-alignment, Musharraf sent the Pakistani army into the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan for the first time since Pakistan's independence. -4.337275243954327
Operations there against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces brought mixed results. -3.5022386980625675
Although the US viewed Musharraf as an agent of change, he has never achieved domestic political legitimacy, and his policies were seen as rife with contradictions. -4.523803329333832
For example, he made alliances with Islamist political forces (who in 2004 voted for constitutional changes legitimizing his position and actions). -4.4003150145479495
At the same time, he sidelined moderate, mainstream political leaders while claiming that he stood for "enlightened moderation." -4.303743507074345
A series of ill-planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region. -3.909682256547328
Last March, Musharraf took his boldest step, removing the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Chaudhry. -4.54481839508301
To the surprise of many, the country's legal community organized a nation-wide movement to restore the Chief Justice to his post. -4.438454395035644
Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people demanded the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution, emboldening the judiciary and changing the country's political dynamic. -4.670420820276432
In a historic ruling that Musharraf had little choice but to accept, the Supreme Court itself reinstated the Chief Justice in July. -4.300524104889629
Subsequently, the energized judiciary continued ruling against government decisions, embarrassing the government -- especially its intelligence agencies. -4.505583067340841
Government officials were held accountable for actions that were usually beyond the reach of the law, ranging from brutal beatings of journalists, to illegal confinement for "national security." -3.9009859325258645
Musharraf and his political allies tried to adjust to this new reality, but their patience ran out when the Supreme Court took up petitions against Musharraf's decision to run for president. -4.103244255506276
According to the constitution (originally promulgated in 1973 by an elected parliament), a serving military official cannot run for an elected office. -4.441703039587628
Musharraf was not ready to give up his military post, but also wanted to be a civilian president. -4.522465029049458
While he announced that he would leave his military position "if" he was elected president, his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary. -4.397271883032223
The proceedings of the court over the last few weeks made Musharraf jittery. -4.404886079953242
The decision of the 11-member bench might easily have gone against him. -4.299572744952111
Legally cornered, Musharraf has now decided to abandon constitutionality, removing the leading judges of the Supreme Court and provincial high courts and putting curbs on the media. -4.614704564609523
Lawyers, human rights activists, and political leaders have since been arrested. -4.556486769959744
There is widespread public resentment in response to these moves. -4.734702195958806
Rather than taking responsibility for the deteriorating security situation (as evidenced by regular suicide bomb attacks) and the increasing Talibanization of the tribal areas, Musharraf has tried to blame the judiciary and media. -4.571898184511835
To be sure, in some cases, judicial activism was obvious (though within the realm of constitutional law), and the media also made mistakes; but by no stretch of the imagination can these be linked to religious extremism or support for militancy. -4.5833237711890575
It is unlikely that Musharraf's latest gambit will succeed, as his popular support is at its lowest ebb. -3.8559254607210045
Pakistan's armed forces -- repeated targets of suicide bombers -- have become demoralized. -4.501909151886145
It is difficult to imagine them standing with Musharraf should civil conflict erupt. -4.263673904143585
Nor can a weak, embattled, and disoriented Musharraf be expected to fight Islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to Pakistan. -4.6494796653817545
Opposition political parties are drawing closer together, and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, despite progress in her power-sharing negotiations with Musharraf, has strongly condemned his actions. -4.175047901088188
Human rights bodies, media associations, and lawyers' organizations are expected to defy the emergency, which will pit them against the security forces. -4.5222291537970625
Terrorists may also benefit by attacking a preoccupied army and political forces aligned with Musharraf. -4.434676982765475
In the event of sustained protests and potential violence, top military commanders may decide to send Musharraf home -- a decision that would not be unprecedented in Pakistan's chronically turbulent history. -4.448852625607876
The Making of a Murder in Pakistan -4.888907482404254
The assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the first Muslim woman to lead a Muslim country, is a serious blow to Pakistan's prospects for democracy and, indeed, its viability as a state. -4.04290615889889
As chaos and confusion set in, we should not lose sight of President Pervez Musharraf's partial responsibility for this turn of events. -4.39987614611887
At the very least, he cannot be absolved from his government's failure to provide Bhutto with adequate security. -4.371445980169247
Instead, Bhutto had to pay with her life for courageously challenging extremists of all stripes -- from Al-Qaeda and Taliban to the country's religious political parties and military hardliners. -4.101581588936795
As heir to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the legendary democratic leader who was hanged by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's government in 1979, Benazir emerged as a symbol of resistance at a young age -- but languished in jails and exile in the 1980's. -4.545604741332605
Z. A. Bhutto's legacy was empowerment of the impoverished and defense of ordinary people's rights amid feudalistic politics and military rule. -4.830230720801063
Rather than bowing to the military junta, he embraced the gallows. -4.677552125492236
Hours before his hanging, Benazir was allowed to see her father for the last time, writing in her autobiography: "I told him on my oath in his death cell, I would carry on his work." -4.458088994848331
She largely lived up to the promise. -4.08024364429538
Her first stint as prime minister (1988-90) was brief and disorganized. -4.445122744711368
Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, the former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, confirmed that he sponsored an alliance of right-wing political parties to stop her from getting a parliamentary majority. -4.378122375779112
Information about Pakistan's nuclear program and ISI operations in Afghanistan were out of her domain. -4.397869587261072
Her second term in office (1993-96) was longer and better, but her government again fell early, owing to charges of mismanagement and corruption. -4.348288012332746
In reality, machinations by the intelligence agencies also played a part. -4.489042823867199
The military had developed an entrenched distrust of her, given her position as a popularly supported pro-Western leader who wanted peace with India. -4.4552923354986245
After almost a decade in self-imposed exile, Bhutoo's return to Pakistan in October gave her a fresh political start. -4.280218604267389
Pakistan had changed, as military dictatorship and religious extremism in the north played havoc with the fabric of society. -4.363391699529947
A tentative arrangement with Musharraf, together with Western support -- particularly from the United Kingdom and the United States -- eased her return, which hundreds of thousands of people welcomed, though terrorists greeted her with a string of suicide bombings. -4.363536734074112
Bhutto's contacts with Mushararf's military government drew criticism, but she remained adamant that a return to democracy was possible only through a transition in which Musharraf would give up his military post, become a civilian head of state, and conduct free and fair elections. -4.335130670736061
To the dismay of some democratic forces, Bhutto stayed the course even after Musharraf imposed emergency rule on November 3 and removed the country's top judges to ensure his re-election. -4.338159132356931
Indeed, she even persuaded other important political leaders to participate in the planned January 8 election, which she viewed as an opportunity to challenge religious extremist forces in the public square. -4.099036074625296
She seized that opportunity by bravely traveling throughout the country, despite serious threats to her life, arguing for a democratic and pluralistic Pakistan. -4.178609861425829
One can understand why religious extremists like Al-Qaeda and Taliban would target her, and the government claims that it is impossible to defend against a suicide attack. -4.040235515798577
But Bhutto was reportedly killed by a sharp shooter before the terrorist blew himself up. -3.893366787550958
So, in the eyes of Pakistan's people, and especially of Bhutto's supporters, the intelligence services, either alone or in collaboration with extremists, finally decided to eliminate her. -4.161920275828382
Whether or not the government was involved, the fact remains that Pakistan has lost a desperately needed leader. -4.360303805669571
With Pakistan's future in the balance, the West's help and support will be crucial, but that means recognizing that Musharraf is not the only leader who can resolve Pakistan's myriad problems and manage the war on terror. -4.383349637106654
On the contrary, by nurturing the current environment of instability and uncertainty, Musharraf himself must be regarded as one of Pakistan's biggest problems. -4.424752801466341
Exorcising Musharraf's Ghost -5.16062793092361
CAMBRIDGE -- Following its recent free elections, Pakistan is rebounding politically. -4.761772914873273
But the euphoria that came with the end of the Musharraf era is wearing off, as the new government faces stark choices. -4.104787975375565
Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan, democracy is not new to this 60-year-old state, but ethnic cleavages, weak institutions, and religious extremism in the North are perennially destabilizing. -4.531429187011065
And, while the new government settles in and establishes its priorities, the West, especially the United States, must reassess the impact of its past dealings with Pakistan. -3.9875486933420246
Pakistan's new prime minister, Yousaf Gilani, is a seasoned politician and, more importantly, has Sufi family roots, which is a good omen because of the Sufi tradition of tolerance. -4.322505946256757
Gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority, and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by Musharraf. -4.235088292605597
The respite from the horrendous spate of suicide bombings since the new government assumed power is similarly heartening. -4.280570907487157
But the honeymoon period is coming to an end. -4.404600824420145
Already, in Gilani's hometown of Multan, rioters attacked government offices and banks to protest electricity disruptions. -4.232273539108894
A couple of well-known opposition politicians, a chief minister and a federal cabinet minister of the previous pro-Musharraf government, were publicly thrashed, raising doubts about government control over law and order in the country. -4.203418699786578
So far, Musharraf has accepted his diminishing stature quietly -- though he has few other options. -4.2665185658355895
The new political leadership, both inside and outside the parliament, has been carefully avoiding a head-on collision with the president. -4.261904221124926
Interestingly, in the midst of the political transition, Musharraf embarked on a week-long visit to China to lobby for construction of an oil and gas pipeline between China and the Persian Gulf that would be routed through Pakistan. -4.390499358221591
The deeper question raised by this proposal is whether Musharraf meant to convey a message to the US that Pakistan's priorities were shifting. -4.414625024104346
The revival of democratic politics in Pakistan will undoubtedly effect Pakistan-US relations. -4.7445995155223
Pakistan's military links with America appear to remain on a sound footing, so the strategic alliance with the US is likely to continue, perhaps with some nuanced differences over how to fight the "war on terror." -4.356690572124978
But Pakistani politicians are bound to be influenced by domestic public opinion, which is generally critical of US policies. -4.554469953550204
Nevertheless, long-term US interests in the region will be better served if Pakistan's democratic forces successfully establish themselves. -4.214893017725283
A proposal in the US Senate to increase development and education aid to Pakistan could help in winning the hearts and minds. -4.126532654322082
Meanwhile, President George W. Bush has said that "if another September 11-style attack is being planned, it probably is being plotted in Pakistan and not Afghanistan." -4.5196729970770315
Whether this American intelligence assessment is based on credible information is unknown. -4.656392887332108
American election-year politics may also be behind this assertion. -4.115342776529596
But it is significant that Bush decided to voice this view during Pakistan's political transition. -4.682507834956471
Pakistan must take this view seriously, regardless of Bush's motivations. -4.376558861990118
The new government should quickly devise a policy to deal with terrorism. -4.310777560801332
Recent months have seen dozens of suicide bombings and other terrorist activities -- the price of Pakistan's own past blunders, as well as those of the West. -4.3059945778078035
Afghanistan is a prime example, as is the failure to settle the Kashmir imbroglio with India. -4.16397686582724
