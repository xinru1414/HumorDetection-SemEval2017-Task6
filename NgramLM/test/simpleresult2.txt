Musharraf's Last Act? -4.56666707993
Desperate to hold onto power, Pervez Musharraf has discarded Pakistan's constitutional framework and declared a state of emergency. -4.90288591385
His goal? -4.43992185593
To stifle the independent judiciary and free media. -5.38774871826
Artfully, though shamelessly, he has tried to sell this action as an effort to bring about stability and help fight the war on terror more effectively. -6.6502571106
Nothing could be further from the truth. -4.91453647614
If Pakistan's history is any indicator, his decision to impose martial law may prove to be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back. -5.18423366547
General Musharraf appeared on the national scene on October 12, 1999, when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious "nation-building" project. -5.13411808014
Many Pakistanis, disillusioned with Pakistan's political class, remained mute, thinking that he might deliver. -5.34482145309
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America brought Musharraf into the international limelight as he agreed to ditch the Taliban and support the United States-led war on terror. -7.06379699707
Musharraf clamped down on some religious militants operating inside Pakistan and also on those fighting Indian forces in Kashmir. -5.10337257385
As a result, Pakistan was rewarded with American financial assistance and arms. -4.68950128555
In furtherance of his re-alignment, Musharraf sent the Pakistani army into the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan for the first time since Pakistan's independence. -6.59044933319
Operations there against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces brought mixed results. -4.74214220047
Although the US viewed Musharraf as an agent of change, he has never achieved domestic political legitimacy, and his policies were seen as rife with contradictions. -6.30338382721
For example, he made alliances with Islamist political forces (who in 2004 voted for constitutional changes legitimizing his position and actions). -4.74060297012
At the same time, he sidelined moderate, mainstream political leaders while claiming that he stood for "enlightened moderation." -5.6489238739
A series of ill-planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region. -8.03942012787
Last March, Musharraf took his boldest step, removing the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Chaudhry. -6.68811178207
To the surprise of many, the country's legal community organized a nation-wide movement to restore the Chief Justice to his post. -5.90358161926
Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people demanded the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution, emboldening the judiciary and changing the country's political dynamic. -8.19657897949
In a historic ruling that Musharraf had little choice but to accept, the Supreme Court itself reinstated the Chief Justice in July. -6.13969087601
Subsequently, the energized judiciary continued ruling against government decisions, embarrassing the government -- especially its intelligence agencies. -4.74573373795
Government officials were held accountable for actions that were usually beyond the reach of the law, ranging from brutal beatings of journalists, to illegal confinement for "national security." -5.5899643898
Musharraf and his political allies tried to adjust to this new reality, but their patience ran out when the Supreme Court took up petitions against Musharraf's decision to run for president. -6.04593467712
According to the constitution (originally promulgated in 1973 by an elected parliament), a serving military official cannot run for an elected office. -6.2555770874
Musharraf was not ready to give up his military post, but also wanted to be a civilian president. -5.35681056976
While he announced that he would leave his military position "if" he was elected president, his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary. -5.79272794724
The proceedings of the court over the last few weeks made Musharraf jittery. -6.85686254501
The decision of the 11-member bench might easily have gone against him. -6.4781537056
Legally cornered, Musharraf has now decided to abandon constitutionality, removing the leading judges of the Supreme Court and provincial high courts and putting curbs on the media. -7.57172441483
Lawyers, human rights activists, and political leaders have since been arrested. -5.21942424774
There is widespread public resentment in response to these moves. -4.37758302689
Rather than taking responsibility for the deteriorating security situation (as evidenced by regular suicide bomb attacks) and the increasing Talibanization of the tribal areas, Musharraf has tried to blame the judiciary and media. -9.48107719421
To be sure, in some cases, judicial activism was obvious (though within the realm of constitutional law), and the media also made mistakes; but by no stretch of the imagination can these be linked to religious extremism or support for militancy. -7.23920106888
It is unlikely that Musharraf's latest gambit will succeed, as his popular support is at its lowest ebb. -4.67984819412
Pakistan's armed forces -- repeated targets of suicide bombers -- have become demoralized. -5.18055772781
It is difficult to imagine them standing with Musharraf should civil conflict erupt. -4.67906761169
Nor can a weak, embattled, and disoriented Musharraf be expected to fight Islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to Pakistan. -5.03901863098
Opposition political parties are drawing closer together, and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, despite progress in her power-sharing negotiations with Musharraf, has strongly condemned his actions. -5.78355789185
Human rights bodies, media associations, and lawyers' organizations are expected to defy the emergency, which will pit them against the security forces. -4.74140262604
Terrorists may also benefit by attacking a preoccupied army and political forces aligned with Musharraf. -5.33915567398
In the event of sustained protests and potential violence, top military commanders may decide to send Musharraf home -- a decision that would not be unprecedented in Pakistan's chronically turbulent history. -4.87158632278
The Making of a Murder in Pakistan -5.40881872177
The assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the first Muslim woman to lead a Muslim country, is a serious blow to Pakistan's prospects for democracy and, indeed, its viability as a state. -7.49137067795
As chaos and confusion set in, we should not lose sight of President Pervez Musharraf's partial responsibility for this turn of events. -5.21376276016
At the very least, he cannot be absolved from his government's failure to provide Bhutto with adequate security. -4.87074804306
Instead, Bhutto had to pay with her life for courageously challenging extremists of all stripes -- from Al-Qaeda and Taliban to the country's religious political parties and military hardliners. -6.81828308105
As heir to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the legendary democratic leader who was hanged by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's government in 1979, Benazir emerged as a symbol of resistance at a young age -- but languished in jails and exile in the 1980's. -7.28475618362
Z. A. Bhutto's legacy was empowerment of the impoverished and defense of ordinary people's rights amid feudalistic politics and military rule. -6.19096422195
Rather than bowing to the military junta, he embraced the gallows. -5.44128513336
Hours before his hanging, Benazir was allowed to see her father for the last time, writing in her autobiography: "I told him on my oath in his death cell, I would carry on his work." -6.12291145325
She largely lived up to the promise. -5.4370174408
Her first stint as prime minister (1988-90) was brief and disorganized. -4.73366308212
Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, the former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, confirmed that he sponsored an alliance of right-wing political parties to stop her from getting a parliamentary majority. -5.52301836014
Information about Pakistan's nuclear program and ISI operations in Afghanistan were out of her domain. -4.74034786224
Her second term in office (1993-96) was longer and better, but her government again fell early, owing to charges of mismanagement and corruption. -4.74048614502
In reality, machinations by the intelligence agencies also played a part. -5.32094287872
The military had developed an entrenched distrust of her, given her position as a popularly supported pro-Western leader who wanted peace with India. -6.17565011978
After almost a decade in self-imposed exile, Bhutoo's return to Pakistan in October gave her a fresh political start. -5.04450511932
Pakistan had changed, as military dictatorship and religious extremism in the north played havoc with the fabric of society. -6.56938314438
A tentative arrangement with Musharraf, together with Western support -- particularly from the United Kingdom and the United States -- eased her return, which hundreds of thousands of people welcomed, though terrorists greeted her with a string of suicide bombings. -8.70025444031
Bhutto's contacts with Mushararf's military government drew criticism, but she remained adamant that a return to democracy was possible only through a transition in which Musharraf would give up his military post, become a civilian head of state, and conduct free and fair elections. -5.76652765274
To the dismay of some democratic forces, Bhutto stayed the course even after Musharraf imposed emergency rule on November 3 and removed the country's top judges to ensure his re-election. -5.42796468735
Indeed, she even persuaded other important political leaders to participate in the planned January 8 election, which she viewed as an opportunity to challenge religious extremist forces in the public square. -7.92479705811
She seized that opportunity by bravely traveling throughout the country, despite serious threats to her life, arguing for a democratic and pluralistic Pakistan. -4.74050760269
One can understand why religious extremists like Al-Qaeda and Taliban would target her, and the government claims that it is impossible to defend against a suicide attack. -6.29507303238
But Bhutto was reportedly killed by a sharp shooter before the terrorist blew himself up. -5.01088905334
So, in the eyes of Pakistan's people, and especially of Bhutto's supporters, the intelligence services, either alone or in collaboration with extremists, finally decided to eliminate her. -6.71638870239
Whether or not the government was involved, the fact remains that Pakistan has lost a desperately needed leader. -5.5064496994
With Pakistan's future in the balance, the West's help and support will be crucial, but that means recognizing that Musharraf is not the only leader who can resolve Pakistan's myriad problems and manage the war on terror. -7.68004560471
On the contrary, by nurturing the current environment of instability and uncertainty, Musharraf himself must be regarded as one of Pakistan's biggest problems. -4.7466301918
Exorcising Musharraf's Ghost -4.43103933334
CAMBRIDGE -- Following its recent free elections, Pakistan is rebounding politically. -4.4133181572
But the euphoria that came with the end of the Musharraf era is wearing off, as the new government faces stark choices. -7.22028064728
Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan, democracy is not new to this 60-year-old state, but ethnic cleavages, weak institutions, and religious extremism in the North are perennially destabilizing. -6.33540964127
And, while the new government settles in and establishes its priorities, the West, especially the United States, must reassess the impact of its past dealings with Pakistan. -5.64449262619
Pakistan's new prime minister, Yousaf Gilani, is a seasoned politician and, more importantly, has Sufi family roots, which is a good omen because of the Sufi tradition of tolerance. -7.30656051636
Gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority, and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by Musharraf. -5.92100858688
The respite from the horrendous spate of suicide bombings since the new government assumed power is similarly heartening. -7.09151601791
But the honeymoon period is coming to an end. -4.86822080612
Already, in Gilani's hometown of Multan, rioters attacked government offices and banks to protest electricity disruptions. -4.34559297562
A couple of well-known opposition politicians, a chief minister and a federal cabinet minister of the previous pro-Musharraf government, were publicly thrashed, raising doubts about government control over law and order in the country. -7.59694433212
So far, Musharraf has accepted his diminishing stature quietly -- though he has few other options. -5.52122211456
The new political leadership, both inside and outside the parliament, has been carefully avoiding a head-on collision with the president. -6.23635005951
Interestingly, in the midst of the political transition, Musharraf embarked on a week-long visit to China to lobby for construction of an oil and gas pipeline between China and the Persian Gulf that would be routed through Pakistan. -7.98914766312
The deeper question raised by this proposal is whether Musharraf meant to convey a message to the US that Pakistan's priorities were shifting. -6.71227884293
The revival of democratic politics in Pakistan will undoubtedly effect Pakistan-US relations. -5.88670492172
Pakistan's military links with America appear to remain on a sound footing, so the strategic alliance with the US is likely to continue, perhaps with some nuanced differences over how to fight the "war on terror." -6.41333866119
But Pakistani politicians are bound to be influenced by domestic public opinion, which is generally critical of US policies. -5.79925966263
Nevertheless, long-term US interests in the region will be better served if Pakistan's democratic forces successfully establish themselves. -5.85726547241
A proposal in the US Senate to increase development and education aid to Pakistan could help in winning the hearts and minds. -7.03852701187
Meanwhile, President George W. Bush has said that "if another September 11-style attack is being planned, it probably is being plotted in Pakistan and not Afghanistan." -5.82046842575
Whether this American intelligence assessment is based on credible information is unknown. -4.70265817642
American election-year politics may also be behind this assertion. -4.98334407806
But it is significant that Bush decided to voice this view during Pakistan's political transition. -6.40335845947
Pakistan must take this view seriously, regardless of Bush's motivations. -5.00550413132
The new government should quickly devise a policy to deal with terrorism. -6.23510169983
Recent months have seen dozens of suicide bombings and other terrorist activities -- the price of Pakistan's own past blunders, as well as those of the West. -6.66893434525
Afghanistan is a prime example, as is the failure to settle the Kashmir imbroglio with India. -5.51749897003
