This directory contains the install script and various run scripts of the system.

install.sh: install script to set up KenLM
lm_news_runit.sh: run script to run Duluth using trigram LM trained on the news data
lm_train_runit.sh: run script to run Duluth using trigram LM trained on the tweets data.
rm_runit.sh: baseline script for both tasks.
evaluation.sh: evaluation script provided by SemEval

Note that for the news training data, you'll have to prepare it yourself. Here are the steps:
1. Go to http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/translation-task.html, under "Download" section, download the News Commentary corpus and the News Crawl corpus from 2008, 2010 and 2011.
2. Combine them into one input file (input.txt)
3. Feed the input file into KenLM, name the N-gram LM as "text_un.arpa":
code/kenlm-master/build/bin/lmplz -o 3 -S 70% < mydata/input.txt > mydata/text_un.arpa
Now the news LM is ready to use.
